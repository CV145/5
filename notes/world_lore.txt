WORLD LORE - DUST AND REDEMPTION
=================================

SETTING: American West, Summer 1899
- End of the 19th century, old ways dying out
- Frontier towns struggling to survive
- Mix of realistic Western and supernatural horror elements

PERDITION - THE MAIN TOWN
=========================

Location: Edge of nowhere, desert frontier town
Population: Small, declining (maybe 200-300 people)
Description: "Where the desert swallows hope and spits out ghosts"

Key Locations:
- Main Street: Central thoroughfare, site of major confrontations
- Abandoned Church: Where Elijah prays, contains prophetic murals
- Saloon: Social hub, potential fortress location
- Undertaker's Parlor: Where major revelations occur
- Sheriff's Office: Sheriff found murdered in Chapter 3
- Hotel: Where travelers stay
- Old Mine: Potential evacuation site for civilians
- Doctor's Office: Thomas could set up practice

History:
- Founded by people who knew about supernatural threats
- Original founders bound "The Hungry Dark" beneath the town
- Town built on cardinal points to maintain supernatural binding
- Binding has weakened over generations
- Church murals painted by founder with "the Sight" - show four figures against darkness

Current State (1899):
- Dying town, people leaving for bigger cities
- Sheriff murdered by unknown supernatural forces
- Vulnerable to both human and supernatural threats
- Perfect location for ancient evil to manifest

THE SUPERNATURAL WORLD
======================

The Hungry Dark:
- Ancient entity predating human civilization
- Feeds on negative emotions: pain, trauma, fear, despair
- Was formless until fed enough suffering
- Bound by early settlers but binding weakened over time
- Can be defeated by unity, hope, and redemption
- Takes physical form when sufficiently fed

The Sight:
- Psychic ability some people possess
- Allows seeing supernatural threats and future events
- Elijah's great-grandfather had it (painted the church murals)
- May be hereditary (Elijah showing signs?)

Ritual Magic:
- Medallions can channel spiritual energy
- Cardinal points (North, South, East, West) have power
- Four souls marked by tragedy can create powerful rituals
- Trauma can be transformed into different energies (hope vs. despair)

Prophecy Elements:
- Four figures standing against great darkness
- Mentioned by the Cross family patriarch
- Could be interpreted as prophecy or instruction manual
- Seems to specifically reference Elijah, Maria, Thomas, and Jacob

THE CROSS FAMILY HISTORY
========================

Family Background:
- Religious family with history of supernatural encounters
- Father was a preacher who spoke of prophecies
- Both Elijah and Silas inherited religious knowledge
- Family may have connection to Perdition's founding

The Original Congregation Burning:
- Silas burned their shared congregation years ago
- Fed their fear and faith to a "lesser manifestation"
- Elijah believed Silas died in the fire
- This taught Silas that "gods are made, not born"

Current Family Status:
- Elijah: Seeking redemption, lost faith
- Silas: Became occultist, seeks to create/become god
- Both carry trauma from the congregation incident
